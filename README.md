#  Sales and Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This project aims to build predictive models for forecasting **retail sales (Units Sold)** and **demand (Demand Forecast)** using both **traditional machine learning models**, **deep learning models**, and **time series forecasting techniques**.

Effective forecasting of sales and demand is essential for businesses to optimize inventory management, improve customer satisfaction, and streamline their supply chain.

##  Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **R² Score**

These metrics help assess model performance in terms of accuracy and error minimization. The higher the R² and the lower the error metrics, the better the model.

##  Top Model Performance

Here are the best-performing models based on the evaluation metrics:

| Model                            | Target              | MAE      | MSE       | RMSE     | R² Score   |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **MLP**                          | Demand Forecast      | 0.004381 | 0.000037  | 0.006100 | **0.999308** |
| **BiLSTM + CNN**                 | Sales Prediction     | 0.004398 | 0.000044  | 0.006643 | **0.999232** |

>  These two models showed remarkable performance, with near-perfect R² scores, making them the top models for demand and sales forecasting.
